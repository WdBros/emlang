# emlang

to run: (make sure you have g++!)
- `make`
- `./emlang`

currently, the only valid operators are +, -, *, and /, though this can be very easily expanded.

## viewing
the main file is "calculator.cpp"
as for the rest, their name mostly describes their function

## roadmap
- implement n-parameter functions (sin, pow, etc.)
- make the linter more robust
- implement strings
